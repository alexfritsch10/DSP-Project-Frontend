**Purpose**:
These are one of those projects you do just for the experience and fun of it, I really have no need for it but who knows, maybe I'll
make my own automation software and this will make for a good UI for creating the process flow. I'll probably add on to this from time to
time.

Note, if you have a need for this sort of interface for some application but you need it to do more, give me a ring maybe we can work
together. I'm always open to working on interesting and worthwhile projects.
